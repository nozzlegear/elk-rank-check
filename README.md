# Elk Rank Check

This is a simple Node + Express website that I use for managing my Warcraft raid team. Given a list of members, it queries the Blizzard guild API to check that they're all at the desired rank (Raider, in this case). 

# TODO 
 - [] Check that Discord permissions are available to the member.
 - [] Use Levenshtein distance to find members who might possibly match the character name.
